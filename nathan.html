    All across the word, in various countries and cultures, sports have an important role in society. The sports may be similar or different, but the passion for athletic activities is the same; in fact, the global sports industry has an estimated worth of 620 billion dollars.   
   </p>
   <p>
     However, with the tremendous growth of the industry, sports have shifted away from its roots - its orginal intentions: 
  </p>
  <p class="thick">
      Sports were intended to be a public service. 
  </p>
  <p>
    Today, sports have become a source of inequality. 
  </p>
   <h4>
     Income
   </h4>

  <li> It was found that children with financially insecure and/or less educated parents are less likely to get involved in sports ("Social Inequalities in Young Children's Sports Participation and Outdoor Play." International Journal of Behavioral Nutrition and Physical Activity, vol. 11)</li>
  <li>With the sports industry becoming so large (and profitable), the costs of playing sports have increases as well. According to LaxAllStars, a lacrosse gear company, a new player would have to spend more than 600$ to start playing. This only includes the bare minimum of gear and not cleats, a backup stick, various team feas, and costs for travel. </li>
  <li>These high costs have become associated with many different sports, and is a barrier to many who want to play. </li>
   <h4>
    Race
   </h4>
  
  <li>Income and social class are also closey linked to another factor: race</li>
  <li> A 2014 Dutch study found that children of ethnic minorities are significantly less likely to participate in sports or even play outdoors</li>
  <li> Gyöngyi Földesi, the head of the Doctoral Program at the University of Physical Education in Bucharest said, “exclusion from sport is strongly linked to social and demographic factors”</li>
  <li>The truth is that many sports have come to be dominated by specific demographics. </li>
  
   <h4>
     Gender
   </h4>
  
  <li>Gender stereotypes often lead to unequal opportunities in sports for men and women (feminine stereotypes) </li>
  <li>One example is golfing. Almost 77% of golfers are male - a direct reflection of unequal opportunities. </li>
  <li>From young ages, girls are often denied the same opportunities due to feminine stereotypes; Phumzile Mlambo- Ngcuka, the Executive Director of UN Women, explains, "“the pressure to conform to traditionally ‘feminine’ stereotypes leads many girls to abandon sport entirely"</li>
  <li>Furthermore, some argue that the very separation of genders in sports fosters inequality. </li>
